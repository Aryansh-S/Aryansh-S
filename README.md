### About Me

Iâ€™m a senior at Washington High School passionate about applying STEM to help marginalized groups in society, such as those with extreme disabilities and diseases, the elderly, and the impoverished. I've been a top contestant in county, state, national, and international science fairs since middle school, utilizing them as platforms to share my research projects, and earned awards in academic olympiads including the USACO and AMC. Harnessing my work, I've built communities rooted in collaborative self-discovery, and written research papers, code repositories, and The Art of Modular Arithmetic.
